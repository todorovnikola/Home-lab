The plan is to create a server hosted on a reaspberry pi 5
connected to a SSD

Router via optical wire setup as well

So far i have installed the cooling fan upgrade and the case
needa install arch os and flash another flash drive to have tails for more privacy

will add the ssd shortly
but need a way to mount it

and mount the berry in the case more snug
